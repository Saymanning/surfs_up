## Surfs Up

### Overview of the analysis:
 
The purpose of this analysis was to gather more data and information about temperature trends before opening the surf and ice cream shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


**- The first step was to determine the Summary Statistics for June**

  Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database was filtered to retrieve all the 
  temperatures for the month of June. Then those temperatures were converted to a list, a DataFrame was created from the list, and the summary statistics were generated.

**- The second step was to determine the Summary Statistics for December**

  Again, using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database was filtered to retrieve all the     temperatures for the month of December. Then those temperatures were converted to a list, a DataFrame was created from the list, and the summary statistics was generated.
